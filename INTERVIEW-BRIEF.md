# Technical Interview Brief: Company Lookup API

This interview builds directly on the **Company Lookup** coding assessment you completed in Codility.

The aim is to simulate a realistic delivery lifecycle: starting from an existing product-style requirement, refining it collaboratively, and then implementing a clean, production-minded HTTP API using modern development practices (including AI-assisted tooling).

We are not looking for trick solutions or completeness — we're interested in how you think, refine requirements, structure code, and make sensible engineering decisions under time constraints.

## Interview structure (60 minutes total)

### 5 minutes – Introductions

Quick introductions and confirmation of how the session will run.

### 10–15 minutes – Refinement

We'll discuss the product brief below. You're encouraged to:

- Ask clarifying questions
- Call out ambiguities
- Make reasonable assumptions, and
- Write a short refinement or implementation ticket in Markdown

### ~30 minutes – Implementation

- You'll take your existing Company Lookup logic and expose it behind an HTTP API.
- Any Python framework is fine (FastAPI, Flask, Django, etc.).
- You may use AI-assisted development tools freely.
- Infrastructure code (Terraform, pipelines, cloud setup) is not expected.

### 10–15 minutes – Demo & discussion

You'll walk us through what you built, explain key decisions and trade-offs, and ask any questions you have.

You're welcome to ask questions at any point. Equally, if you prefer to work quietly and focus during the build, that's completely fine.

## Expectations and constraints

- Focus on clear API design, structure, and readability.
- Reasonable request/response validation and error handling are expected.
- Testing (unit or integration) and static analysis are encouraged where time allows.
- No infrastructure, deployment, or cloud configuration is required.
- AI-assisted tooling is explicitly allowed and encouraged — we're interested in how you use it to accelerate delivery while retaining control and clarity.

## What we're evaluating

We'll primarily be looking at:

- How you refine and clarify a loosely defined requirement
- How you structure and expose backend functionality via an API
- The clarity, maintainability, and intent of your code
- Your ability to explain and review your own work

We're not expecting a "perfect" solution — the focus is on approach, judgement, and communication, not raw output.

Likewise, we are not testing the functionality defined in the initial assessment, rather your ability to serve said functionality as part of a production application.

Please commit and push all changes at the end of the interview.
